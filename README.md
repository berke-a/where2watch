PS: This was an early sophomore project. The _messy_ file structure reflects my initial learning curve with Flutter and subsequent updates made after a period away from the framework.

# where2watch

- where2watch is an open source mobile app. It has been created using the open-source framework, Flutter.  
- Shows which platform has the searched movie/series. Additional informations such as imdb rating, plot, duration and links to streaming services can            be accessed too.  
- Used several APIs for the provider informations and for flags icons in country selection page.  
- It is ~~currently~~ published on Google Play.  
      

      
## Screenshots
Here are some of the screenshots I've used while publishing the app to Google Play.
